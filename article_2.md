# Financial

- Finding a job that will can help me finacially will be a huge goal as I have a lot of wants and needs. My first would be trying to find a place in Toronto in order to live my lifestyle down there as all my friends are there. Another would be to wipe the debt I have as a student because I want to have financial freedom.
